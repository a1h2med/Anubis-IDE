# Objective
- This is a simple IDE which will allow you to perform some basic functionalities, created by Anubis Graduation project team in faculty of engineering Ainshams university, supervisor (Professor: **Ayman Bahaa**) 
- The goal of the Anubis IDE was to provide a simple environment to write, edit, compile, and run micropython codes. but It's now an open-source editor which you can freely access and develop.
- We developed Anubis IDE using PYQT5 .
- PyQt5 is a library that lets you use the Qt GUI framework from Python. Qt itself is written in C++. By using it from Python, you can build applications much more quickly while not sacrificing much of the speed of C++.
